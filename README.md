# Lending Club Case Study
> The main goal of this analysis is to reduce financial losses caused by lending money to applicants who are likely to default on their loans. When borrowers don't repay their loans, the lender faces financial losses, which are called credit losses. We want to identify these risky loan applicants through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) so that we can reduce the number of such loans and minimize credit losses. This means finding the factors or variables that strongly indicate loan defaults. By understanding these factors, the company can make better decisions about its loan portfolio and risk assessment.

## General Information
- General Information

* Project Description: This project focuses on analyzing data from the Lending Club, the largest online loan marketplace, with the aim  of identifying key factors that contribute to loan defaults. The primary objective is to understand the driving variables behind loan defaults to reduce credit losses and enhance portfolio and risk assessment strategies through exploratory data analysis (EDA).

* Business Problem: Lending loans to risky applicants is a significant source of financial loss for lenders. Credit loss occurs when borrowers refuse to pay or default on their loans. By identifying these risky loan applicants, the company can reduce credit losses. This analysis aims to uncover strong indicators of loan default to improve risk assessment.

* Dataset: The dataset used for this analysis is from the Lending Club.

## Technologies Used
- Pandas - version 2.1.1
- NumPy - version 1.20.2
- Matplotlib - version 3.8.0
- Seaborn - version 0.12

## Conclusions
- Renters Have a Higher Default Rate: Applicants who are living in rented properties (as opposed to homeowners) tend to default more frequently on their loans. This suggests that homeowners may be more financially stable and have a lower risk of default.

- Debt Consolidation Purpose Leads to More Defaults: Borrowers whose loan purpose is 'debt_consolidation' have a higher rate of default. This could indicate that individuals using loans to consolidate existing debts may face challenges in managing their finances.

- Higher Salary Applicants Choose Specific Loan Purposes: Applicants with higher salaries tend to apply for loans for purposes such as 'home_improvement,' 'house,' 'renewable_energy,' and 'small_businesses.' This suggests that higher-income individuals may be more inclined to invest in property and business-related ventures.

- Interest Rate and Loan Amount Correlation: There is a clear positive correlation between interest rates and loan amounts. As loan amounts increase, the interest rates also tend to increase. This implies that borrowers taking larger loans typically face higher interest charges.
